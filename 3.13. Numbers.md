# 3.13. Numbers 

###Different types of python 

####Types of numbers ()

- integers
  - Whole numbers, positive or negative
- Floating point numbers 
  - Have a decimal point
  - Exponential (e) to define the number
    - 2.0, -2.1
    - 4E2 (4 x 10^2)

####Basic arithmetic 

- `2+1 `= 3
- Like a calculator 
  - +, - , *, / 
- Pay close attention to division
  - / 
  - Python 2 > "classic division" decimal point truncated.
  - Python 3 > "true division" show all decimal points
- `3.0/2` so if I make one number into float, then will get true division
- `float(3)/2` then, it will also make a number a float 


- `from __future__ import division`
  - With this, importing division function work like python3

#### more arithmetics

- `2**3`  = 2^3 (power)
- Root: `4**0.5` 
- Or importing the math module (later in the course)

####Order of operation

* Multiplication before plus
* `2+10*10+3` = 105
* Or custom with () : `(2+10)*(10+3)` = 156

#### setting a label

- `a = 5` 
  - Variable name = assigned number
  - Setting a label 
  - It will set a as 5
  - Also can reassign label
- Couple rules they can flow
  - Cannot start with a number
  - No space
  - All symbols are forbidden
  - Lowercase 

#### variable names

- Some example: 

  - `my_income = 100`
  - `tax_rate = 0.1`
  - `my_taxes = my_income * tax_rate`

- One of best example = using python as calculator
