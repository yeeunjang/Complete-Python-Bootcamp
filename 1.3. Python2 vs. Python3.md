# 1.3. Python2 vs. Python3

### learning version: kind of both 

- why choose python 2 
  - the current environment still uses 2, but need to understand the 3 for the future (python 2 will stop their security update in 2020)
  - because 68% of python users still use 2.x python.
    - legacycode, dependencies
    - more likely that when one get a job, the base would be in 2.7.
- sill the lecture will support python 3 with pyhton 3 alert
  - example: division (/)
    - python 2: "classic" division, the decimal points are truncated.
    - python 3: "true" division, with the decimal points


More information can be found in : https://www.python.org/ 

- Site provides much information about both python 2 and 3
- Beginners guide / intermediate guide etc. provided




> conclusion: will use 2 but will still discuss 3.
